        <div id="online-reputation-management" class="online-reputation-management"> <!--ID and class here are the same. That's at best unneccessary, possibly messing CSS up-->

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

    <div class="benefits"> <!--A lot of these benefit class items have the same css, we can combine them in the CSS into a single class. no reason to do this all multiple times. Also, on the page, the bottom of this box extends below the bottom of the others. Can we get them to line up exactly?-->
